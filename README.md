# Emoji Generation For Facial Expression

A deep learning project that generates emojis based on real-time facial expressions using computer vision and neural networks.

## Overview

This project proposes the development of an application aimed at detecting and representing facial expressions through emojis in real-time. It leverages computer vision and machine learning to analyze facial features, interpret expressions like happiness, sadness, anger, and others, and dynamically generate corresponding emojis.

## Features

- **Real-time Facial Detection and Emotion Recognition**:
  - Analyzes and identifies 7 emotions: Happy 😊, Sad 😢, Angry 😠, Neutral 😐, Surprise 😮, Fear 😨, Disgust 🤢.
- **Live Webcam Integration**:
  - Supports real-time input through a webcam or image uploads.
- **Personalized Emoji Creation**:
  - Generates emojis reflecting user-specific facial expressions.

## Applications

- **Social Media Platforms**:
  Enhanced communication with personalized emojis that reflect true emotions.
- **Messaging Applications**:
  More expressive and nuanced communication through custom emojis.
- **Gaming**:
